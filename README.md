# An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications (Vol. 1) - LaTeX Remastered

> **A digital restoration of William Feller's classic text.**

## 📄 Overview
This repository contains the **LaTeX source code** and compiled **PDF** for *Volume 1 (3rd Edition)* of William Feller's *An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications*.

The project aims to transform the widely circulated scanned copies into a clean, searchable, and vector-based document for a better learning experience.

For scanned copies of the original book, please refer to:

## 🛠️ Methodology
This is an **automated conversion** pipeline:
1.  **[Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker)**: Used for OCR and layout analysis, converting the original PDF into **Markdown** with extracted **JPG images**.
2.  **Pandoc**: Used to convert the intermediate Markdown files into LaTeX format.
3.  **Scripts**: Applied minor adjustments for Unicode support and XeLaTeX compatibility.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
1.  **Unverified Content**: The text and formulas are generated by OCR/AI. **They have not been manually proofread.**
2.  **Layout**: Page numbers and directory structure differ from the original physical book.
3.  **Use Caution**: Please refer to the original printed book for citations or if you encounter ambiguous formulas.

## 🤖 Vision
> "I hope that in the future, AI agents will automatically complete these tasks."

I released this to demonstrate the potential of document restoration. I look forward to a future where AI agents can flawlessly digitize and typeset our mathematical heritage without human intervention.

## 🚀 Usage
To compile the PDF yourself:
1.  Upload the `.zip` file to **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)**.
2.  Set the compiler to **XeLaTeX**.
3.  Recompile.
